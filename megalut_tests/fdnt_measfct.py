"""
This files holds a user-defined measfct.
This way the user has maximum freedom to tweak it, without hardcoding.

It's a very good idea to keep this function in a separate module and not in your
script, so that it can be imported by the multiprocessing pool workers that will call,
it without causing any trouble!
