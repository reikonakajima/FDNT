The galaxy images are generated by the command
> python make_g08.py
(this requires GalSim installation).

The pipeline is 
> FDNT_G3_pipeline.py
which requires SExtractor parameter files, also included in the directory.  
The pipeline file must be edited so that the files are read in from the
correct directory.
